This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Generate Your Custom Story

Start by inputting your name, pronouns, how you feel and what you'd like your character to do. Note that for the app
to work well, your inputs should be valid and driven by creativity.

From there, StoryWeaver.ai will take you along a personalized experience where you'll make decisions 
that shape the story along the way.

At each step, we will make an API call to Cohere, which will be indicated by the buffering symbol.
While you're waiting for it to go through you can interact with the "Moving Points" interactive art piece.
