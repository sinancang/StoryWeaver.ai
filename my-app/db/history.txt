Sinan was feeling moody today. He had no idea why, but he just knew that he needed to get out of the house. So he decided to go for a walk in the park. He had never been to this park before, but he figured it would be a nice change of scenery. He was quickly proven wrong. As soon as he entered the park, he was attacked by a group of rowdy teenagers. They were yelling and screaming and generally causing a ruckus. Sinan tried to ignore them and just enjoy his walk, but they kept following him. Finally, he had enough and he turned around and started yelling at them. This only made them yell even more. Finally, a security guard came and broke up the fight. Thank goodness for that, because Sinan was starting to feel really mad.
