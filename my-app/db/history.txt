Sinan was feeling curious today, so he decided to go out. He saw a lot of things that day, but the thing that stuck out the most was a large group of people fighting. He didn't know what was going on, but he knew that something was wrong. So he decided to try and help. But when he got there, he found out that it was just a regular street fight. People were just fighting for fun, and no one was really hurt. But still, something about the whole scene felt off. He couldn't put his finger on it, but he knew that something was amiss.
 The character could leave the scene and try to forget about what he saw.
