Today, Angela feels very silly and decides to take a walk to clear her head. She strolls through her neighborhood, enjoying the fresh air and the sound of leaves crunching under her feet. But then she sees it: A giant chicken leg lying in the middle of the street. She approaches it cautiously, wondering if it's real or just a figment of her imagination. But when she touches it, she realizes it's definitely real. She can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.
