Angela felt silly today. She had no idea why, but she just couldn't seem to shake the feeling. So she decided to take a walk. She wandered aimlessly for a while, enjoying the fresh air and the sounds of nature around her. But then she saw it. A giant chicken. She blinked twice to make sure she was seeing things correctly. Nope. The chicken was definitely there. And it was definitely huge. She had no idea what it was doing here, but she knew she had to find out. So she approached it cautiously. The chicken didn't move. It just sat there, looking at her. She reached out to touch it. It felt like a normal chicken. But then she realized something. This chicken was not normal. It was some kind of mutant. She had ran away before it could attack her.
