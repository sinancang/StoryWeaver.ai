Today, Angela feels particularly silly. She's not sure why, but she just knows that she needs to get out and take a walk. She starts out slowly, enjoying the fresh air and the sound of the leaves crunching under her feet. But then, she spots something strange. A small creature with wings is sitting on a branch, watching her. Angela gasps and reaches for her phone, but it's gone. She looks around, but there's no sign of it anywhere. The creature leaps off the branch and vanishes into the sky. Angela stands there, staring at the spot it disappeared, feeling very, very silly.
