Doruk sat at his desk, reviewing yet another report detailing the rapidly deteriorating state of affairs in his city. He had been in this same position so many times before, and each time he felt more helpless than the last. But today was different. Today, Doruk felt determined. He would not let the chaos consume him. He would fight back. And he would win.
As if chaos weren't bad enough, some people seem intent on making things even worse. But not our hero, Doruk. He's had enough of this nonsense and is feeling determined today. So he decides to win. And what does he see? A chance to turn everything around.
